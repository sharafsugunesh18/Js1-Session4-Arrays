Problem Description
You are given an array of strings arr as an argument, representing the names of people in a village. A "Zombie" has sneaked into the village and is also part of the array. The zombie eats the person who is to the right of it. Tell the person who is going to be eaten. It is guaranteed that there will always be at least one person to the right of the zombie. From the given function zombieAttack return the name of the person.

Please note: There will be only one "Zombie" in the array.


Hint 1: Iterate through the array using a loop and use string comparison to find the Zombie.

Hint 2: Once you find the zombie, keep track that you have found it and find the person next to it.


Sample Input

Anil, Zombie, Pulkit, Chinmay


Sample Output
Pulkit


Explanation
The first person to the right of "Zombie" is Pulkit. Thus we return Pulkit.


6 Step Strategy to solve problems
Use the 6 step strategy to solve any problem

Understand the problem

Design test data/test cases (i.e. input and expected output)

Derive the solution (write pseudo code for the solution)

Test the solution (do a dry run of the pseudo code for the test data and confirm it works)

Write the program/code (using JavaScript here)

Test the code (debug any syntax errors and logical errors)



/////////

unction zombieAttack(arr) {
  // You only need to implement this function.
  for(var i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
    if(arr[i]=="Zombie"){
      return arr[i+1];
    }
  }
}
