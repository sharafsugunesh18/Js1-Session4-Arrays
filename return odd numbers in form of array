Problem Description
You are given a number n as an argument. You have to implement the function "oddNumbers" to return all odd numbers greater than 0 and less than or equal to n in the form of an array.


Hint: The value of n will be greater than 0.


Sample Input 1

10


Sample Output 1
1, 3, 5, 7, 9


Explanation
The odd numbers from 1 to 10 are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.


6 Step Strategy to solve problems
Use the 6 step strategy to solve any problem

Understand the problem

Design test data/test cases (i.e. input and expected output)

Derive the solution (write pseudo code for the solution)

Test the solution (do a dry run of the pseudo code for the test data and confirm it works)

Write the program/code (using JavaScript here)

Test the code (debug any syntax errors and logical errors)


/////Answer
                   
function oddNumbers(n){
  // You only need to implement this function.
  var oddArray =[];
  for(var i=1;i<=n;i++){
    if(i%2!=0){
      console.log(i);
      oddArray.push(i);
    }
  }
  return oddArray;
}
