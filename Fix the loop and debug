Problem Description
You have been given a function findSum which returns the sum of numbers from 1 to n but there is an error in the code, please debug this problem. You can start by uncommenting the code given in the function. Please note that the value of n will be greater than 0.


Hint 1: Whenever we use loops, we have to make sure that we give proper terminating conditions.

Hint 2: Understand why infinite loops happen. Try printing i and sum in each iteration to figure out what is going wrong.


6 Step Strategy to solve problems
Use the 6 step strategy to solve any problem

Understand the problem

Design test data/test cases (i.e. input and expected output)

Derive the solution (write pseudo code for the solution)

Test the solution (do a dry run of the pseudo code for the test data and confirm it works)

Write the program/code (using JavaScript here)

Test the code (debug any syntax errors and logical errors)





/////Answer

function findSum(n) {

  let i = 1;
  let sum = 0;
    while(i <= n){
    sum += i;
    console.log(i);
    console.log(sum);
      }
      return sum;  
}

if (findSum(3) !== 6)
  console.log("Test fails: Expected 6 for input n = 3");
else
  console.log("Sample test case for input n = 3 passed!");



module.exports = findSum;
