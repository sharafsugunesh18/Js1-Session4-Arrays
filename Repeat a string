Problem Description
You are given a string str and a number k as arguments. You have to implement a function repeatString which will repeat the given string for k times. Return an empty string if k is not greater than 0. For this challenge, do not use the built-in repeat() method.


Hint: Use a while loop to add string k times.


Sample Input 1
"a", 3


Sample Output 1
"aaa"


Explanation
"a" is concatenated 3 times. Thus the returned string is “aaa”.


Sample Input 2
"ab", 4


Sample Output 2
"abababab"


Explanation
"ab" is concatenated 4 times. Thus the returned string is “abababab”.


6 Step Strategy to solve problems
Use the 6 step strategy to solve any problem

Understand the problem

Design test data/test cases (i.e. input and expected output)

Derive the solution (write pseudo code for the solution)

Test the solution (do a dry run of the pseudo code for the test data and confirm it works)

Write the program/code (using JavaScript here)

Test the code (debug any syntax errors and logical errors)


///////Answer

function repeatString(str, k){
  // You only need to implement this function.
  var result = str.concat(k,k);
  return result;
}

if (repeatString("!", 3) !== "!!!")
  console.log("Test fails: Expected '!!!' for input str = '!' and k = 3");
else
  console.log("Sample test case for input str = '!' and k = 3 passed!");

module.exports = repeatString
